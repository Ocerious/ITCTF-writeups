Starting, the challenge includes a link to a file called “`backrooms.mp3`”. After viewing the video you may notice that for a 10th of a second, a Google drive link flashes up on screen.

<p align="center"><img width="80%" src="./assets/backrooms.gif" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><img width="80%" src="./assets/googledrivelink.jpg" /></a></p>

After entering this link into the address bar, we will be greeted by two images; “`ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.png`” and “`treat j as i.png`”.

<img width="50%" src="./assets/ssssssssssssssssssssssssss.png" /><img width="50%" src="./assets/treat j as i.png" /></p>
